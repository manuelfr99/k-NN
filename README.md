# k-NN
Development of a k-NN algorithm from scratch in python

The python file consists of an inefficient script that based on OOP tries to replicate 
a kNN algorithm.

The idea is to use the functions that have defined inside 'class kNN' in order to test the 
accuracy depending on the number of neighbours that we use in the classification.

It is recommended to divide data into training/testing using splitting methods from
sklearn in order to controll manually the size of the test and training data.

Hope you enjoy using the algorithm!
